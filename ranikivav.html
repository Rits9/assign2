<h1> Rani ki Vav</h1>
        <p>
            Built-in the 3rd millennium BC in the memory of the kings, its an explicit example of beautiful Ancient Indian architecture. Constructed during the time of the Solanki dynasty, legend says that it was built in the honour and memory of Bhimdev 1, the son of the founder of the family, by his widowed queen Udayamati. It was recently declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2014, owing to its architectural marvel and splendour. Rani-ki-vav is well known for its Stepped Corridors, Sculptures and Stone Carvings in the Well. Most of the sculptures in the well are devoted to Lord Vishnu in the form of his ten avatars, which signify his return to the world. Apart from being a place for the storage of water, this vav also has a spiritual meaning attested to it. It is designed as an inverted temple and is divided into seven levels of wells, each having its own importance as per the religious and mythological works mentioned in the canonical literature.</p>
