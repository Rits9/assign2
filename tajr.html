    <h2>About Taj Mahal and History</h2>
    The beauty of the Taj Mahal is magnified by the beautiful and traditional features of the Mughal and Persian architecture.

Taj Mahal Architecture
The outward decorations of the Taj Mahal can be described as one of the finest examples of the Mughal architecture. Along with the change in the surface area, the construction is also is also refined equivalently. Paint, stone inlays, carvings and stucco were used to create the decorative elements. There was an Islamic prohibition against the use of the anthropomorphic forms, thus the ornamental elements can be gathered into inscriptions, intellectual forms or vegetative motifs. Throughout the compound are passageways from the Quran that include some of the ornamental elements.

The inscription on the Great Gate recites "O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you. The script was produced in the year 1609 by a calligrapher named Abdul Haq. Shah Jahan deliberated the designation of "Amanat Khan" upon him as a payment for his stunning technique.Much of the lettering is composed of ornate thuluth script completed of jasper or black marbledecorated in white marble panels. Higher panels are transcribed in somewhat larger script to decrease the skewing result when watched from below. The calligraphy created on the marble memorials in the catacomb is predominantly meticulous and subtle.



Intellectual procedures are used throughout, particularly in the plinth, gateway, turrets, jawab, mosque, and, to a lesser degree, on the exteriors of the grave. The domes and arches of the sandstone constructions are functioned with decoration of chiselled painting to make intricate geometric forms. Her ringbone tiles describe the space concerning many of the contiguous elements. White tiles are used in sandstone structures, and dark or black pieces on the white marbles. Mortared parts of the marble buildings have been discoloured or tinted in a conflicting colour which makes a complex display of geometric forms. Floors and paths use complementary tiles or blocks in tessellation decorations.

 Design of Taj Mahal
There are white marble dados carved with accurate bas relief portrayals of flowers and vines on the lower level walls of the tomb. The marble has been refined to highlight the attractive specifying of the artefacts. The dado structures and arch spandrels have been ornamented with pietra dura tiles of extremely schematized, nearly geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are of jasper and jade, yellow marble, refined and flattened to the surface of the walls.

The interior compartment of the Taj Mahal spreads far beyond traditional enhancing basics. The inner hall is an octagon with the scheme permitting for entrance from every face, though only the entrance fronting the garden to the south is in use. The inner walls are around 25 metres (82ft) tall and are surpassed by a "false" inner dome ornamented with a sun theme. Eight pishtaq curves describe the area at ground level as it does with the external; each inferior pishtaq is capped by an additional pishtaq about middle up the wall.

The four dominant higher arches form galleries or viewing areas, and each gallery' sexternal window has acomplicated screen. Furthermore to the light from the balcony, light comes in through roof overturesenclosed by chattris at the corners. The jali bordering the cenotaphs or the octagonal marble screen is made out of eight marble boards carved finished with sophisticated pierce work.

The residual surfaces are decorated in subtle detail with semi-precious stones creating twining vines, flowers and fruits. Each compartment wall is extremely ornamented with complicated lapidary stone and sophisticated calligraphy panels dado bas-relief, which reflect, the intention rudiments seen through the peripheral of the complex.
