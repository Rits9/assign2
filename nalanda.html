    Nalanda Archaeological Site in Bihar was a centre of learning and a Buddhist monastery from 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. You can witness the remains of stupas, shrines, and viharas if you stroll around in the campus, which is a  manifestation of a glorious epoch. Nalanda vouched for the evolution of Buddhism as a religion and remained an abode of knowledge for 800 years. Known for its formalised Vedic learning, scholars from as far as Tibet, China, Korea, and Central Asia once attended the first residential university of the World. This is the second world heritage site recognised by UNESCO in Bihar itself, making it even more prominent in Indian Tourism Map</p>
